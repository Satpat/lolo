# For Puchki

A little website I built for the girl who's 8,288 km away but never feels far.

Floating hearts, a game where you can't say no (literally), our photos, 16 reasons I love you, and the timeline of us. From that first 4-hour call to our first Valentine's Day and hopefully, to a billion more memories.

## Customize

All content lives in one file: `js/config.js` — photos, reasons, timeline, music.

## Run Locally

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Made with &#10084;&#65039; from Adelaide.
